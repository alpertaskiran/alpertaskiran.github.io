Welcome to my blog! My name is Alper and I am a passionate learner and practitioner in the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. I have always been fascinated by the potential of these cutting-edge technologies to transform the world we live in, and have spent countless hours studying and experimenting with different ML algorithms and applications. Through this blog, I hope to share my learnings and findings with like-minded individuals who are equally passionate about exploring the potential of ML and AI. 

As we continue to develop more sophisticated AI systems, it is becoming increasingly important to ensure that these systems are designed with human needs and values in mind. By investigating the intersection of operations research, machine learning, and algorithmic game theory, I hope to contribute to the development of more effective and ethical AI systems that can improve our lives in meaningful ways.

Through this blog, I hope to share my experiences and insights with fellow learners and enthusiasts who are interested in exploring the fascinating world of machine learning and artificial intelligence.So join me as we delve into the exciting world of ML and AI, exploring the intersection of theory and technology along the way.
